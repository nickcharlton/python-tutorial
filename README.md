# Python Tutorial

This repository contains all of the resources for my Python tutorial. It's
designed to introduce people to programming who have none, or very little
experience (although, it's short enough to be useful for those just learning
Python.)
It covers basic syntax, data structures, control structures, functions and
pointers to more resources.

File an issue if something seems wrong. Even better, fix it and send a pull
request.
